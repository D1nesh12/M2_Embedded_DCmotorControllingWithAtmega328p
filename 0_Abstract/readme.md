One of the most common applications in all mechatronic domains is the control of DC motors. To develop a product which will can be used efficiently. In this case, develop a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) to control a servomotor position and speed. Arduino UNO ATMEGA 328 is used to control the motor. This motor is controlled using PID logic (Proportional Integrative Differential). The PID logic is implemented in the motor using the Arduino UNO ATMEGA 328 micro controller. After implementing the above, proteus design is made and PCB is printed. The final printed circuit board will be able to control the motor using PID logic.
